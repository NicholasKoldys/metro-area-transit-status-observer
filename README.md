# MATSO - Metro Area Transit Status Observer 
## WGU Project 2020
## Developed By : @NicholasKoldys

### Description
This project was developed for WGU's "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT - CAPSTONE".  The purpose of the project combines all subjects of the software development degree's curriculum.  The project's application is developed in the programming language **Java**.  The background of the project focuses on a well defined imaginary company or entity and sets out to solve a problem through a software application.  The processes involved focus on the software development lifecycle and all of its necessary documents and tasks.  The documents have not been included due to constraints, however, the source code of the end project is viewable and runnable with the necessary java capable environment.  The application introduces a graphical user interface connected to a remote database.  The application tracks buses, routes, and various attributes, while displaying information in graphs and charts.  The application allows multiple users, with seperate permsissions pertaining to each.  Upon login the user with enhanced permsissions will be allowed to manipulate the data with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), while the user with minimal permissions will be allowed dashboard and report viewing with no data manipulation capabilities.
